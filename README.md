# equinoxbooking
 little passion project of mine. 
 i am making this website because i noticed that this booking particular booking site 
 does not have one, and uses shopify and a 3rd party ticket site to sell any products. 
 i thought it would be cooler if they had their own custom site, that handles all payments for them instead.
 as of right now, i am going for that old, myspace kind of style, as i thought that would best fit the vibe
 for the site. i have plans of the site being able to allow users to create accounts, and also process payments
 using shopify's api. i also would like to write my own ticket-code generation for when users purchase tickets
 to any events. this project is very early on in development (began: 4-8-25, writing this readme: 4-9-25) so many
 features and details are bound to change. this is my first time working on a full-fledged site using react and
 tailwind, so a few bumps are bounds to occur.
